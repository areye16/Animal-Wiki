            <p> The litters consist of two to three cubs, but sometimes there can be up to six. They are born with spots and as they grow older the spots fade into their fur, and their eyes aren't open until ten days after birth. The mother stays in the den with the cub as they feed from her milk but are left alone so she can hunt so they are very vulnerable at this time.
